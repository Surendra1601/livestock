            <h2>About Livestock Health Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
                Livestock health monitoring is the process of collecting and analyzing data to identify and prevent health problems in livestock. This can be done using a variety of methods, including sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Livestock health monitoring is important for a number of reasons. First, it can help farmers to identify and treat health problems early, before they become serious. This can save money on veterinary costs and improve animal welfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, livestock health monitoring can help farmers to improve their overall herd management practices. By tracking data on animal health, nutrition, and behavior, farmers can identify areas where they can improve their operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, livestock health monitoring can help to protect public health. By monitoring livestock for diseases that can be transmitted to humans, farmers can help to prevent the spread of these diseases.
